## User Story
```
As a hungry person who wants to try something new, I want to use Food Roulette to find a nearby restaurant at random, so that I can discover new places to eat without spending time scrolling through endless options.

As a busy student and an indecisive foodie, I want to be able to find lesser-known restaurants in my area based on preferences I enter into a web application so that I can spend less time deciding what to eat and more time studying.
